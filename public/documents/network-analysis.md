# Network Security Analysis Report

## Overview
This analysis examines the network architecture and security implementations, focusing on identifying potential vulnerabilities and recommending security improvements.

## Network Architecture
- Network Topology
- Security Controls
- Access Points
- Network Segmentation

## Traffic Analysis
### Tools Used
- Wireshark
- Nmap
- Network Monitoring Tools

### Key Findings
1. Traffic Patterns
   - Unusual port activity
   - Unencrypted communications
   - Suspicious network behaviors

2. Security Gaps
   - Open ports
   - Weak encryption
   - Misconfigured services

## Vulnerability Assessment
### Critical Issues
1. Exposed Services
2. Outdated Protocols
3. Insufficient Monitoring

### Recommendations
1. Network Hardening
   - Close unnecessary ports
   - Update encryption standards
   - Implement IDS/IPS

2. Monitoring Improvements
   - Deploy SIEM solution
   - Enhance log collection
   - Set up alerts

3. Security Controls
   - Update firewall rules
   - Implement NAC
   - Enhance network segmentation
